# pmkit – Product Management Toolkit (OpenProject-based)

`pmkit` is a reusable, self-hostable product management toolkit centered around OpenProject, packaged as a managed Python project. It is designed to give a turnkey environment for product management work (roadmapping, backlog management, release planning), while remaining **extensible** for additional custom tools and integrations.

## Goals

- Provide a standardized, repeatable PM environment that can be spun up on any machine with minimal setup.
- Wrap OpenProject in a simple, Python-managed framework that supports:
  - Containerized deployment
  - Persistent data volumes
  - Configuration via code and environment variables
- Make it easy to extend the toolkit with additional services (custom microservices, utilities, CLI tools) over time.
- Support private reuse across machines via a private GitHub repository.

## Core Requirements

- Use **OpenProject (Community Edition)** as the core PM application.
- Run OpenProject in Docker, with:
  - Configurable ports and hostnames.
  - **Persistent volumes** for application data (e.g., database, assets).
- Provide a clear, minimal “one-command” (or near one-command) startup workflow.

## Project Structure & Tooling

- Implemented as a **Python project**.
- Dependency management via **UV**.
- Project metadata and dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`.
- Intended usage:
  - Clone the private GitHub repo.
  - Install Python/UV dependencies.
  - Run a small Python/CLI entrypoint (or Make-like command) to:
    - Generate/configure Docker (and Docker Compose, if used).
    - Start/stop the stack.
    - Manage configuration (e.g., `.env` handling, secrets placeholders).

## Features (Initial Scope)

- **OpenProject container orchestration**
  - Docker (and optionally Docker Compose) definitions managed/generated by Python code.
  - Environment variables for host name, protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), and secrets.
  - Built-in support for **persistent volumes**:
    - Data volume for database.
    - Volume for OpenProject assets (attachments, uploads, etc.).
- **Configuration management**
  - Central config (e.g., YAML/TOML/JSON or `.env`) describing:
    - Ports
    - Volumes paths
    - Base URLs
  - Python code to read config and apply it to the container definitions.
- **Simple lifecycle commands**
  - Start, stop, restart the environment.
  - Initialize data volumes if missing.

## Extensibility

Design `pmkit` as a framework that can be extended with additional services and tools, for example:

- Additional containers (e.g., reverse proxy, auxiliary services).
- Custom Python utilities:
  - CLI helpers for importing/exporting data (e.g., Excel-based work package sync).
  - Scripts to bootstrap OpenProject projects, users, or custom fields via API.
- Plugin-style architecture:
  - A place in the project structure where new tools/services can be added without changing the core.
  - Clear patterns for registering new components (e.g., adding a new service to the Docker stack).

## Repository & Usage Model

- Hosted in a **private GitHub repository**.
- Primary use case: reuse on multiple machines and environments:
  - Developer laptops (macOS, Windows + WSL, Linux).
  - Personal servers or lab environments.
- Expected user workflow:
  1. Clone `pmkit` from private GitHub.
  2. Set basic configuration (e.g., copy `.env.example` to `.env`).
  3. Run a Python/CLI command to bring up the stack.
  4. Access OpenProject via browser and use it as the central PM hub.

## Non-Goals (for now)

- Not targeting public distribution (no need for PyPI packaging initially).
- No built-in multi-tenant user management beyond what OpenProject already provides.
- No requirement to support multiple orchestrators (Kubernetes, etc.) initially—focus on Docker first.

------

Use this description to:

- Scaffold the Python project (`pyproject.toml`, package layout, CLI entrypoint).
- Define the Docker/Docker Compose configuration.
- Implement volume handling and configuration management.
- Leave clear extension points for future tools under the `pmkit` umbrella.
